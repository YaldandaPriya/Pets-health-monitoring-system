# Pets-health-monitoring-system
PET’s HEALTH MONITORING SYSTEM is a wearable always-on health tracker that monitors a pet’s health and activity levels to generate a wellness score, providing the owner with a big picture of the animal’s overall health. While some wearable trackers are wireless tags attached to a normal pet collar, the Pet Pace Collar is an actual collar.

**Components Used**:
ADXL335 Accelerometer Module
Accelerometer ADXL335 sensor
ECG Electrodes
Connecting Wire Jumper Wires
DS18B20 Waterproof temperature sensor
Lithium Ion Battery 3.7V 2500mAh 18650
NodeMCU ESP8266
Pulse senor
AD8232 ECG Sensor Kit
Vector board

**Introduction:**
As the healthcare industry continues to embrace the digital era and advance remote patient monitoring, it’s no surprise that this technology is also transforming the pet health industry. The wireless pet wearables industry has expanded from location trackers to include solutions powered by IoT technologies that help owners monitor their pet’s health.

**Problem Statement:**
Every living creature on this earth has equal importance within the ecosystem. But at present, the lives of the animals are in risk. There is an increasing number of issues regarding various animal health condition and movements. And in recent era, pets have become an integral part of a human life. For many of us, pets are real family members, and we take care of them, their health, and well-being. At present to detect the health status of animal we required to wait for veterinary expertise which take long time for its arrival.

**Solution:**
Pet’s health monitoring system is a belt which can be used to check all the vital parameters of their pets in real-time. Such belts can measure heart rate, temperature etc. By using ECG sensor, we can measure heart rate and with temperature sensor we can measure the pet’s body temperature. If any serious changes occur in any parameters that can be taken as signs of illness, it will send an alert to the pet owner. Physical activity is very important for pets. Modern applications can analyze walking distance, time of activity per day etc. We can use ADXL accelerometer to count the steps during walking. If a pet is not active enough during the day, an owner will be notified. To control all the sensors, we use NodeMCU8266 microcontroller.
